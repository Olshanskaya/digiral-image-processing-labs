# Ð¡ourse: Digital Image Processing Algorithms 


**Lab 1: Image Color Correction and Histogram Processing**

In this lab, we delve into the fundamentals of image color correction. We explore techniques such as linear histogram stretching and histogram equalization to enhance image contrast and improve visual quality.

**Lab 2: Image Contour Detection Algorithms**

Lab 2 is all about contour detection in images. We implement and compare the Roberts, Prewitt, and Sobel filters to highlight edges and boundaries within the images.

**Lab 3: Gaussian Blur Implementation**

In Lab 3, we tackle the implementation of the Gaussian Blur algorithm. This operation is essential for reducing noise and achieving a smoothing effect on images.

**Lab 4: Morphological Operations**

Lab 4 covers morphological operations like erosion, dilation, opening, and closing. These operations play a significant role in image segmentation and feature extraction.

**Lab 5: Canny Edge Detector**

For Lab 5, we focus on the Canny Edge Detector, a powerful algorithm for accurately detecting edges in images. Through this lab, you will gain insights into edge detection techniques widely used in various computer vision applications.
